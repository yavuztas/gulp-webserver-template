This boilerplate can be used when you need a simple http server just to serve static content

### How do I set up? ###

* Copy your static content into "dist/" folder.
* Run "npm install" for the first time.
* Default port is 9001. You can edit it inside "gulpfile.js".
* Run "npm run serve" to start your server.
* Enjoy!
